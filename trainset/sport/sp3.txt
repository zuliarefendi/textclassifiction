Ravens release Pollard in latest salary cap purge



OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) â€” Strong safety Bernard Pollard has been released by the Baltimore Ravens, the latest move driven by the Super Bowl champion's offseason salary cap purge.

Pollard announced his departure Wednesday on Twitter, writing, "Well Ravens Nation. it's been fun. My time in Baltimore is done."

The 28-year-old Pollard signed a three-year extension with Baltimore last season, but his release saves the Ravens an estimated $1 million against the salary cap.

Pollard played two years with Baltimore. Last season, he had 71 tackles and an interception despite playing much of the year with six broken ribs.

He is the fifth player to leave the Ravens over the last two weeks, following guard Bobbie Williams, wide receiver Anquan Boldin and linebackers Paul Kruger and Dannell Ellerbe.
