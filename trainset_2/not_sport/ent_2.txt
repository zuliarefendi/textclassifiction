'Veronica Mars' fans swarm Kickstarter in hopes of film

Can a Veronica Mars movie really happen?

Fans of the canceled series have been wondering that for years, and star Kristen Bell and creator Rob Thomas have only fueled the fire by repeating that, yes, they'd be interested in putting the cult series on the big screen.

At long last, the movie became a near-reality today when an official Veronica Mars Kickstarter popped up.

The campaign calls for $2 million in fan donations to fund a VM feature. If the goal is reached, it will be the largest Kickstarter-funded project of all time.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and predict the project will surpass its goal â€” probably within 24 hours. Last I checked, more than $275,000 had been raised, and the number changes almost every minute. (Seriously, just click on the link and stare for a few seconds. You'll be amazed.)

Incentives to give include everything from copies of the script to personalized voicemail messages to the opportunity to be an extra in the film. If funded by April 12, the movie will shoot this summer.

Check out the adorable promo video below, which includes appearances by Bell, Thomas the cast. Further updates will be posted
