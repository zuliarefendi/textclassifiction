'19 Kids and Counting' star Michelle Duggar: I still want more kids



Michelle Duggar, the mother behind the TLC mega-family “19 Kids and Counting,” would still love to have a 20th child.

The reality star told RadarOnline even at 46, she still wants more children but fears she may be too old.

“If God saw fit for us to receive another child we would love that and welcome that,” she told the website. “Well, I’m 46 years old, and if this is the end for me being able to bear children then that is God’s timing. I will rejoice no matter where I find myself.”

Her oldest son and his wife are about to welcome their third child, and Duggar said she loves being a grandmother.

“Having grandchildren is like cream on the top of a wonderful sundae!”

In 2011, Duggar was pregnant with her 20th child but miscarried.
