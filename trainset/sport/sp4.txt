NFL: Free agent Wes Welker said to be insulted by Patriots' offer

Wes Welker seems to be the sensitive type.

Last week, we heard that the free-agent receiver was still holding a grudge for being underused by the New England Patriots in Game 1 of the 2012 season, during which he went on to be the team's top receiver for the fifth straight year.

Now NFL.com is reporting that Welker is unhappy with the Patriots' contract offer, which was "substantially lower" than what he expected.

So now it seems Welker might actually be a legitimate possibility for teams in the market for a wide receiver, joining the likes of Greg Jennings and Danny Amendola as one of the top names still out there.

Of course, all this alleged unhappiness could just be a ploy to drive his price tag up. Or maybe the five-time Pro Bowl selection truly is insulted by the way he is being treated by the Patriots.

Either way, all will be cured once Welker signs his name on the dotted line and starts cashing those sure-to-be-large-enough paychecks from one team or another.
