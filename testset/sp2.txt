Couch Slouch on the Miami Heat winning streak

How is it possible the Miami Heat has won 22 straight games? Of course, there are the Three Tenors: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the other guy. But in a move that hasn’t drawn too much attention, Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra often puts them on the floor with no one else.

That’s right — for most of the game, the Heat plays three-on-five; once in a while, Shane Battier comes in, but we’ll get back to him later.

(How do I know all this? For $149, I bought NBA League Pass this season, which means that every NBA game comes into my shattered home every night, and I watch them all. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to becoming Michael Wilbon, unless he gets me membership into one of his country clubs.)

While we have a moment, let’s compare the Heat’s historic run against two other recently ballyhooed spells:

● The Dow Jones’s 10-session winning streak.

●The Chicago Blackhawks’ 24 straight games earning a point.

Wall Street is rigged; I’m not savvy enough to know how, but I’m just smart enough to know it is. I mean, corporate profits are soaring again, yet most of us are stumbling through the supermarket wondering, “A pound of bacon is $6.49? How did that happen?”

Meanwhile, with Tim Donaghy out of the league, we assume the Heat’s streak is an honest one.

Besides, the Dow has had four other 10-plus winning streaks. The most recent came in November 1996, coinciding with a 10-day presidential streak in which Bill Clinton winked at a White House intern.

Note: The New York Stock Exchange traded six days a week instead of five until May 1952, back when men were men and MLB hurlers threw 175 pitches a game and liked it.

(Column Intermission: Stephen Strasburg will be the Washington Nationals’ opening day starter. As a precautionary measure, he will only throw out the ceremonial first pitch.)

Now, what the Blackhawks did is impressive: Starting the season earning a point in 24 consecutive games. But it loses a little luster when you consider the cockamamie NHL changed its rules in 1999, allowing teams to earn a point when they lose in overtime. Heck, in the NHL, you could lose every game you play — and still win your division!

See, where I come from — the nation’s capital, home of the federal government and taxation without representation — you don’t get rewarded for a defeat, unless you land a good lobbying job on K Street after you’ve been run out of Congress.

People — even LeBron — treated it like the Blackhawks were on a winning streak. Except that during their streak, they lost three times.

(Incidentally, using NHL math, I might argue I’m on a three-marriage points streak — sure, two of them ended in divorce, but I was “even” with my ex-wives through the first three months of each union.)

I think it’s important to remember that during this Heat streak, the team is winning all of its games — and winning them with Battier often on the court.

Many, many block/charge calls ago, Battier was national player of the year at Duke, and he was part of the Houston Rockets’ 22-game win streak in the 2007-08 season. These days, he sets up shop just beyond the three-point line, usually in the corner — I believe he has a desk and a reading lamp over there — and waits for his teammates to reverse the ball to him, then catches and shoots a wide-open 22-foot half-inch jumper with his eyes closed.

He does nothing else — the team reportedly fines him if he goes in the paint — reflected by his stats: 0.9 assists, 0.7 blocked shots and 0.5 steals per game. He somehow averages 2.3 rebounds, but most of them are his own misfired three-pointers that clank off the rim and ricochet back into his lap. Of his 287 field goal attempts, 252 have been three-pointers — he shoots 43 percent from beyond the arc and only 34 percent on two-pointers; all the activity near the basket, I assume, bothers him.

Hey, you try winning 22 in a row with this stationary mope on the floor.

Column Footnote: The Denver Nuggets’ 11-game winning streak has been largely overlooked; then again, unlike the Heat, they play five-on-five, and at altitude.
