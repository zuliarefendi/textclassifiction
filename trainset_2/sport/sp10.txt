MIAMI – A few hours after their victory over Italy in the World Baseball Classic Tuesday, Robinson Cano got a new pair of shoes, slightly used.

From LeBron James.

Cano and some of his Dominican Republic teammates went to watch James and the Miami Heat extend their winning streak to 19 straight games with a 98-81 victory over Atlanta at American Airlines Arena. James signed a pair of his sneakers for Cano and Cano tweeted a photo of the two of them together.

"I've met LeBron a few times. I'm a fan," Cano said. "All you guys know he's a Yankee fan. When he was in Cleveland, he wore the hat and he got booed. That means a lot to us. He was the man in Cleveland and wore a Yankee hat.

"That was so kind of him to sign those shoes for me."

Cano seemed delighted by the trip. But he won't be wearing the sneaks anytime soon – they won't fit.

"No chance," Cano said, laughing.
