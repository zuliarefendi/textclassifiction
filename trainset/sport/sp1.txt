Quotable: Bill Belichick on Patrick Chung

One of the more intriguing signings the Philadelphia Eagles made yesterday was former New England Patriot and Oregon Duck defensive back Patrick Chung. Roob wrote earlier today that Chung fell out of favor with his old coach, but we wanted to take a look to see what Bill Belichick had to say about him in the past.

Our searches didn't prove overly fruitful, but there were a few bites from the Pats coach from this past December.

    “Patrick has done a great job for us in many different areas, whether it’s his coverage ability or his ability to tackle or to adapt in different situations,” Belichick said. “He certainly has some good experience, played a lot of football for us, and has that side to bring to the game also. It’s a different array of things that he can do that help us in different situations that allows us to be a little bit more multiple in different packages.”

In another video interview Belichick says Chung really helped the young guys adjust.

    Patrick's a smart kid and really understands football concepts, works hard, is very in tune to not only his job but what everyone else is doing.

On the flip side, Chung called Belichick a genius in the below video.

Chung also commented on his old Oregon coach back when there were rumors about Chip making the jump to the NFL, but came short of calling him a genius.

    "He's a beast, man," Chung said. "He's definitely a good coach. He's a great coach, he's very intense. I love Chip.
