FILE - MARCH 13, 2013: New England Patriots star receiver Wes Welker has signed a two-year, $12 million deal to play for the Denver Broncos.

After averaging 112 catches per year over six seasons with Brady in New England, the Pro Bowl receiver agreed to a two-year, $12 million deal Wednesday to team up with Manning in Denver.

The Welker signing was the highlight of a big day for the Broncos, who once again made a major splash in free agency.

Denver also came to terms on a two-year deal with defensive tackle Terrance Knighton, formerly of Jacksonville, and a one-year contract with linebacker Stewart Bradley, who played with the Cardinals the past two seasons.

Last year, the Broncos won the high-stakes contest to sign Manning, prompting Broncos boss John Elway to quip, "Plan B? I don't have a Plan B. We're going with Plan A."

Coming off a 13-3 season during which the Broncos looked like a Super Bowl contender before losing to Baltimore in the division round of the playoffs, Elway is clearly on the same path this time.

He picked up the league's most productive receiver to play in the slot where Brandon Stokley was last season. Welker's five 100-catch seasons are the most in league history. He has been selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his past five seasons and was an All-Pro four of the past six years.

"When you look at Wes in the middle of the field, you can't cover him," Elway said. "He does such a tremendous job of getting open, finding seams in zones, beating man-to-man coverage. So, he'll be a huge asset for us inside."

Welker caught 118 passes for 1,354 yards and scored six touchdowns last year, helping the Pats go 12-4 and make the AFC title game before they also fell to Baltimore.
