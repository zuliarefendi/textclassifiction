Letters to Taylor Swift found in recycling dumpster


If Taylor Swift hasn't responded to your lovingly crafted letter, take heart - maybe it just took a little detour to a dumpster first.

As CNN affiliate WKRN reports, Nashville resident Kylee Francescan found a heap of letters addressed to Swift in an area recycling dumpster when she was dropping off old newspapers.

"There were hundreds of letters written to Taylor Swift," Francescan said. "I didn't know if they were stolen, or if somebody discarded them, so I threw them in a box, and I was like, 'somebody needs to let Taylor know.'"

She called WKRN because she wanted to make sure Swift found out about the discarded correspondence, some of which was already opened and some of which was still sealed.

"It just really bothered me, because I know how much her fans mean to her," Francescan said.

Some of the letters were elaborately decorated, and WKRN said return addresses came from around the globe. Fans were trying to send their letters to Taylor Swift Entertainment, which has a P.O. box in Hendersonville. It seems that someone from Swift's staff will swing by the P.O. box every so often to pick up the "box loads" of fan mail that arrive.

A spokeswoman for Swift, Paula Erickson, told WKRN that they didn't know about the recycling mishap, but did offer a possible explanation.

"Taylor gets thousands of fan letters everyday and they are delivered to her management office. After the letters are opened and read, they are recycled," Erickson said. "The only explanation for any letters being unopened would be that a small batch of mail that was supposed to be delivered to Taylor was accidentally put with letters headed for the recycling center. ... We plan to immediately pick up the mail."
