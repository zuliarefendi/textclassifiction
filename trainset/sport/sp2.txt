Bayern Munich v Arsenal: travelling Arsenal supporters look on the bright side ahead of Champions League tie

Flurries of snow were swirling around the Marienplatz, the traditional gathering spot in Munich town centre ahead of any football match. 
 But the bitter March wind wasn’t going to stop the several hundred Arsenal fans patronising the open air bar opposite the ornate town hall there from enjoying their day.

Nor, it seemed, were Arsène Wenger’s selection decisions depressing the mood. The Arsenal manager’s announcement that he was now prioritising Saturday’s game against Swansea and fielding his second string against the rampant German champions Bayern Munich had done little to suppress the enthusiasm.

“I booked this long before the first leg,” said Barry Flynn, who had flown over from Dublin with his father Pat. “I’m looking at it as a holiday in a great city, watching a match in a great stadium between two great teams.

"Well, one great team will be involved at least.”

Flynn had arrived on Tuesday night, and decided immediately after the 3-1 home defeat in the first leg that he was going to enjoy himself whatever.
