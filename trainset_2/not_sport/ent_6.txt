Lady Gaga's 24k Gold Wheelchair (Photo)

We all saw the sneak peek that Lady Gaga posted of her wheelchair (which she affectionately named "Emma") before she went in for hip surgery.

However, it seems as though Mother Monster has decided to pimp her ride!

Gaga's new set of wheels is a 24-karat gold plated "chariot" with a black leather seat and a removable leather canopy.

And if sitting becomes too tiresome for the recovering pop star, the chair fully reclines to instantly become a bed on wheels!

The designer, Ken Borochov, said that he was pleasantly surprised when he received the request. Although he had designed jewelry and other metal pieces for stars like Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Cher Lloyd and even other items for Gaga, this was his first wheelchair.

"I certainly wasn't expecting that phone call and have never done a wheelchair," he told the the New York Post. "But [I] am always up for a challenge and was thrilled to create what I affectionately dubbed the Chariot, a chair fit only for a queen."

Lady Gaga underwent hip surgery on February 20th due to synovitis, a severe inflammation of the joints.

We don't care which wheelchair she uses, we just wish her a speedy recovery!

What do you think of Mother Monster's upgraded wheels?
