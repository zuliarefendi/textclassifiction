American Idol: Advice and Dream Set Lists for the Season 12 Top 10

The American Idol Top 10 kick off the Season 12 finals tonight (8/7c on Fox), and if this year’s crop of contenders get innovative and avoid the same old boring ballads (like, say, “I Have Nothing” or that Phil Collins chestnut whose title shall not be uttered), we could be in for two months of great performances and nail-biting competition.

Alas, though, there are numerous sinkholes and blind curves on the road to Idol glory. Which is why I put together a gallery laying out the strengths and weaknesses of every Season 12 contestant, along with actionable advice for improvement (hear me, fools!) and a list of unexpected songs they’ll want to consider.

Angie Miller

Strengths: Thanks to a gorgeous self-penned ballad she performed in Hollywood Week and the bold choice of a Colton Dixon Christian-radio hit for the Top 20 round, Angie has been described as an “artist” by the judges moreso than any of her Season 12 rivals. She’s got a big voice, a clear vision of who she is artistically and a great smile, to boot.

Weaknesses: Angie’s also had more hype this season than any of her competitors — and high expectations can often be a heavy burden to carry. Plus, when she’s not behind the piano (i.e. her Top 40 cover of “Nobody’s Perfect”) Angie tends to push her vocals to not-entirely-pleasant extremes.

Dream Set List: The Lumineers’ “Ho Hey,” Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights”; Til’ Tuesday’s “Voices Carry,” Fiona Apple’s “Shadowboxer,” Blake Lewis’ “Heartbreak on Vinyl,” Guns N’ Roses’ “Patience”
