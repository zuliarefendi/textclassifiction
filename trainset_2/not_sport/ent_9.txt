Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth split reports won't quit

Are Miley and Liam over? Or not?
The rumors of romance trouble in Miley Cyrus paradise have been bubbling for months.

The singer and her actor fianc√© Liam Hemsworth have had celeb watchers wagging about a split, despite Miley's tweet last week, saying, "I didn't call off my wedding. Taking a break from social media. #draining"

Today, Page Six reports that "multiple sources" say the two are over.

Hemsworth, 23, who was spotted in a car with January Jones at a pre-Oscar party, has jetted off to his native Australia because, Page Six says, "He needed to get away from Los Angeles and spend some time with his brother and friends."

Miley, 20, meanwhile, who is busy working on new music, has stepped out without her engagement ring on, which doesn't help dispel the buzz.

People mag reported on Monday that Hemsworth flew home so the two "could have a break," but quoted an unnamed source as saying "it doesn't mean they have split."

No word from either camp on the fresh buzz.
